## National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant Funding Analysis

This project seeks to provide a look at some facets of grant funding through NINDS.

Publicly-available Funding data was pulled from NIH RePorter tool which stores grant award data from 1993-2019.

This data was used to mine individual author information from Scopus using the Scopus API in Python.

The data was combined in Python. The website was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and visualizations were built in D3.js.

Python scripts cannot be run. Certain data with individual researcher information could not be included publicly for this project. Data used for visualizations have been aggregated and deidentified.
